### What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. <br>
It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available. <br>
The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot. <br>
K8s as an abbreviation results from counting the eight letters between the "K" and the "s". Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. <br>

### Why you need Kubernetes and what it can do

Containers are a good way to bundle and run your applications.  <br>
In a production environment, you need to manage the containers that run the applications and ensure that there is no downtime.  <br>
For example, if a container goes down, another container needs to start. Wouldn't it be easier if this behavior was handled by a system?  <br>

That's how Kubernetes comes to the rescue! Kubernetes provides you with a framework to run distributed systems resiliently.  <br>
It takes care of scaling and failover for your application, provides deployment patterns, and more.  <br>
For example, Kubernetes can easily manage a canary deployment for your system.  <br>
