### Pods
Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes. <br>
A Pod is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers. <br>


**Official documentation of Pods** : https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods

### Deployments
A Kubernetes Deployment is used to tell Kubernetes how to create or modify instances of the pods that hold a containerized application. <br>
Deployments can scale the number of replica pods, enable rollout of updated code in a controlled manner, or roll back to an earlier deployment version if necessary. <br>
